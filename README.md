# AI News Assistant

Newspapers  have  been  a  constant  source  of news and information for us for about 400 years now. Many technological advancements led to newer ways of delivering news  and  information  about  various  aspects.
This app uses AI to fetch the news and read it to its users and assist them in their journey to consuming news in a healthy manner, both physically (reducing eye strain and screen time) and mentally (future plan includes creating a desenationalising filter, more on this can be found in the design document).

__NOTE__ : 
- I have provided my own API Keys for the purposes of demostration and will be soon deactivating them. It is advised that you use your own API Key.
- I intended to provide the functionality of using Alan AI hotword to trigger the assistant using voice commands, making the app 100% hands free. But couldn't implement it as the developement version (unpaid) of the SDK doesn't allow that. Only paid versions are allowed to integrate that functionality.
